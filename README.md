**Who uses Cloud Computing**
- Organizations of every type, size and industry use the cloud for varying use cases such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. 

- E.g. Healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makeers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

**Types of Cloud Computing**
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space. IaaS delivers the highest level of flxibility and management control over your IT resources.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (hardware and OS), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you dont need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
Provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. You dont have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.
